- `associate_public_ip_address` (bool) - Whether allocate public ip(eip) to your instance.
  Default value is false. If you set this field `true`,
  please set the `network_capacity_in_mbps` field to allocate
  public network bandwith

- `use_default_network` (bool) - Use default vpc, subnet, securitygroup, if the field is set `true`.
  if the field is set `false` or not set, the build process will use
  a vpc, subnet, securitygroup that you offer or create a temporary vpc,
  subnet, securitygroup, which will be deleted after building.

- `instance_name` (string) - The name of instance which will be launch. Usually it will be deleted
  after build, cancellation or error

- `description` (string) - The description of instance

- `security_group_id` (string) - ID of the security group to which a newly
  created instance belongs. Mutual access is allowed between instances in one
  security group. If not specified, the newly created instance will be added
  to the default security group. If the default group doesn’t exist, or the
  number of instances in it has reached the maximum limit, a new security
  group will be created automatically.

- `security_group_name` (string) - The security group name

- `internet_charge_type` (string) - Internet charge type

- `eip_name` (string) - Eip name

- `network_capacity_in_mbps` (int) - Eip network bandwith

- `root_disk_size_in_gb` (int) - RootDiskSizeInGb

- `root_disk_storage_type` (string) - RootDiskStorageType

- `vpc_id` (string) - The VPC id for your build process will perform in. If the field
  `use_default_network` is used. This field will be invalid

- `vpc_name` (string) - The VPC name. If the field `use_default_network` and `vpc_id`
  both are unset, the build process will create a temporary
  vpc network with the name of `vpc_name`

- `vpc_cidr_block` (string) - Cidr block for VPC. If the temporary vpc network is created, the
  `vpc_cidr_block` will be used to set cidr for vpc

- `subnet_id` (string) - The id of subnet where the bcc instance will be launched on

- `subnet_cidr_block` (string) - The cidr block of subnet which will be created
  if subnet id is not specified

- `subnet_name` (string) - The subnet name which will be created if subnet id is not specified

- `keypair_id` (string) - Keypair id for ssh. baiducloud use keypair id as unique identification.
  And maybe there more than one keypairs have the same name. So please
  use `keypair_id` instead of `ssh_keypair_name`

- `data_disks` ([]BaiduCloudDataDisk) - Add one or more data disks to the instance before creating the image.
  The data disks allow for the following argument:
  -  `storage_type` - Type of the data disk.
  -  `cds_size_in_gb` - Size of the data disk.
  -  `snapshot_id` - Id of the snapshot for a data disk.

- `run_tags` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair tags to apply to the instance that is *launched*
  to create the image.

- `user_data` (string) - User data to apply when launching the instance.
  It is often more convenient to use user_data_file, instead.
  Packer will not automatically wait for a user script to finish before
  shutting down the instance this must be handled in a provisioner.

- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file that will be used for the user
  data when launching the instance.
