- `associate_public_ip_address` (bool) - Whether allocate public ip(eip) to your instance.
  Default value is false. If you set this field `true`,
  please set the `network_capacity_in_mbps` field to allocate
  public network bandwith

- `use_default_network` (bool) - Use default vpc, subnet, securitygroup, if the field is set `true`.
  if the field is set `false` or not set, the build process will use
  a vpc, subnet, securitygroup that you offer or create a temporary vpc,
  subnet, securitygroup, which will be deleted after building.

  after build, cancellation or error

- `description` (string) - The description of instance

- `security_group_id` (string) - ID of the security group to which a newly
  created instance belongs. Mutual access is allowed between instances in one
  security group. If not specified, the newly created instance will be added
  to the default security group. If the default group doesn’t exist, or the
  number of instances in it has reached the maximum limit, a new security
  group will be created automatically.

- `security_group_name` (string) - The security group name

- `internet_charge_type` (string) - Internet charge type, there are two type: `BANDWIDTH_POSTPAID_BY_HOUR` and
  `TRAFFIC_POSTPAID_BY_HOUR`.

  both are unset, the build process will create a temporary
  vpc network with the name of `vpc_name`

- `vpc_cidr_block` (string) - Cidr block for VPC. If the temporary vpc network is created, the
  `vpc_cidr_block` will be used to set cidr for vpc

- `subnet_id` (string) - The id of subnet where the bcc instance will be launched on

- `subnet_cidr_block` (string) - The cidr block of subnet which will be created
  if subnet id is not specified

- `keypair_id` (string) - Keypair id for ssh. baiducloud use keypair id as unique identification.
  And maybe there more than one keypairs have the same name. So please
  use `keypair_id` instead of `ssh_keypair_name`

- `run_tags` (map[string]string) - Add one or more data disks to the instance before creating the image.
  The data disks allow for the following argument:

  It is often more convenient to use user_data_file, instead.
  Packer will not automatically wait for a user script to finish before
  shutting down the instance this must be handled in a provisioner.

- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file that will be used for the user
  data when launching the instance.

### Communicator Configuration

In addition to the above options, a communicator can be configured
for this builder.

#### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `communicator` (string) - Packer currently supports three kinds of communicators:
  
  -   `none` - No communicator will be used. If this is set, most
      provisioners also can't be used.
  
  -   `ssh` - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This
      is usually the default.
  
  -   `winrm` - A WinRM connection will be established.
  
  In addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they
  can use. For example, the Docker builder has a "docker" communicator
  that uses `docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy
  files.

- `pause_before_connecting` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - We recommend that you enable SSH or WinRM as the very last step in your
  guest's bootstrap script, but sometimes you may have a race condition
  where you need Packer to wait before attempting to connect to your
  guest.
  
  If you end up in this situation, you can use the template option
  `pause_before_connecting`. By default, there is no pause. For example if
  you set `pause_before_connecting` to `10m` Packer will check whether it
  can connect, as normal. But once a connection attempt is successful, it
  will disconnect and then wait 10 minutes before connecting to the guest
  and beginning provisioning.

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `ssh_host` (string) - The address to SSH to. This usually is automatically configured by the
  builder.

- `ssh_port` (int) - The port to connect to SSH. This defaults to `22`.

- `ssh_username` (string) - The username to connect to SSH with. Required if using SSH.

- `ssh_password` (string) - A plaintext password to use to authenticate with SSH.

- `ssh_ciphers` ([]string) - This overrides the value of ciphers supported by default by golang.
  The default value is [
    "aes128-gcm@openssh.com",
    "chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com",
    "aes128-ctr", "aes192-ctr", "aes256-ctr",
  ]
  
  Valid options for ciphers include:
  "aes128-ctr", "aes192-ctr", "aes256-ctr", "aes128-gcm@openssh.com",
  "chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com",
  "arcfour256", "arcfour128", "arcfour", "aes128-cbc", "3des-cbc",

- `ssh_clear_authorized_keys` (bool) - If true, Packer will attempt to remove its temporary key from
  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This is a
  mostly cosmetic option, since Packer will delete the temporary private
  key from the host system regardless of whether this is set to true
  (unless the user has set the `-debug` flag). Defaults to "false";
  currently only works on guests with `sed` installed.

- `ssh_key_exchange_algorithms` ([]string) - If set, Packer will override the value of key exchange (kex) altorighms
  supported by default by golang. Acceptable values include:
  "curve25519-sha256@libssh.org", "ecdh-sha2-nistp256",
  "ecdh-sha2-nistp384", "ecdh-sha2-nistp521",
  "diffie-hellman-group14-sha1", and "diffie-hellman-group1-sha1".

- `ssh_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with SSH.
  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the
  home directory of current user.

- `ssh_pty` (bool) - If `true`, a PTY will be requested for the SSH connection. This defaults
  to `false`.

- `ssh_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The time to wait for SSH to become available. Packer uses this to
  determine when the machine has booted so this is usually quite long.
  Example value: `10m`.

- `ssh_disable_agent_forwarding` (bool) - If true, SSH agent forwarding will be disabled. Defaults to `false`.

- `ssh_handshake_attempts` (int) - The number of handshakes to attempt with SSH once it can connect. This
  defaults to `10`.

- `ssh_bastion_host` (string) - A bastion host to use for the actual SSH connection.

- `ssh_bastion_port` (int) - The port of the bastion host. Defaults to `22`.

- `ssh_bastion_agent_auth` (bool) - If `true`, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate with the
  bastion host. Defaults to `false`.

- `ssh_bastion_username` (string) - The username to connect to the bastion host.

- `ssh_bastion_password` (string) - The password to use to authenticate with the bastion host.

- `ssh_bastion_interactive` (bool) - If `true`, the keyboard-interactive used to authenticate with bastion host.

- `ssh_bastion_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with the
  bastion host. The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the
  home directory of current user.

- `ssh_bastion_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with bastion host.
  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the
  home directory of current user.

- `ssh_file_transfer_method` (string) - `scp` or `sftp` - How to transfer files, Secure copy (default) or SSH
  File Transfer Protocol.

- `ssh_proxy_host` (string) - A SOCKS proxy host to use for SSH connection

- `ssh_proxy_port` (int) - A port of the SOCKS proxy. Defaults to `1080`.

- `ssh_proxy_username` (string) - The optional username to authenticate with the proxy server.

- `ssh_proxy_password` (string) - The optional password to use to authenticate with the proxy server.

- `ssh_keep_alive_interval` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - How often to send "keep alive" messages to the server. Set to a negative
  value (`-1s`) to disable. Example value: `10s`. Defaults to `5s`.

- `ssh_read_write_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The amount of time to wait for a remote command to end. This might be
  useful if, for example, packer hangs on a connection after a reboot.
  Example: `5m`. Disabled by default.

- `ssh_remote_tunnels` ([]string) - 

- `ssh_local_tunnels` ([]string) - 

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; -->


<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `temporary_key_pair_type` (string) - `dsa` | `ecdsa` | `ed25519` | `rsa` ( the default )
  
  Specifies the type of key to create. The possible values are 'dsa',
  'ecdsa', 'ed25519', or 'rsa'.

- `temporary_key_pair_bits` (int) - Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. For RSA keys, the
  minimum size is 1024 bits and the default is 4096 bits. Generally, 3072
  bits is considered sufficient. DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits as
  specified by FIPS 186-2. For ECDSA keys, bits determines the key length
  by selecting from one of three elliptic curve sizes: 256, 384 or 521
  bits. Attempting to use bit lengths other than these three values for
  ECDSA keys will fail. Ed25519 keys have a fixed length and bits will be
  ignored.

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSHTemporaryKeyPair struct in communicator/config.go; -->


- `ssh_keypair_name` (string) - If specified, this is the key that will be used for SSH with the
  machine. The key must match a key pair name loaded up into the remote.
  By default, this is blank, and Packer will generate a temporary keypair
  unless [`ssh_password`](#ssh_password) is used.
  [`ssh_private_key_file`](#ssh_private_key_file) or
  [`ssh_agent_auth`](#ssh_agent_auth) must be specified when
  [`ssh_keypair_name`](#ssh_keypair_name) is utilized.


- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.
  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory
  of current user.


- `ssh_agent_auth` (bool) - If true, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate connections to
  the source instance. No temporary keypair will be created, and the
  values of [`ssh_password`](#ssh_password) and
  [`ssh_private_key_file`](#ssh_private_key_file) will be ignored. The
  environment variable `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` must be set for this option to work
  properly.


## Basic Example

Here is a basic example for Baiducloud using the officially recommended HCL2 format.

<Tab heading="HCL2">

```hcl
variable "access_key" {
  type    = string
  default = "${env("BAIDUCLOUD_ACCESS_KEY")}"
}

variable "secret_key" {
  type    = string
  default = "${env("BAIDUCLOUD_SECRET_KEY")}"
}

source "baiducloud-bcc" "example-1" {
  access_key      = "${var.access_key}"
  secret_key      = "${var.secret_key}"
  region          = "fwh"
  zone            = "cn-fwh-a"
  source_image_id = "m-sDghxZu1"
  instance_spec   = "bcc.ic4.c2m2"
  image_name      = "packer-test"
  associate_public_ip_address = true 
  use_default_network         = true 
  ssh_username                = "root"
  run_tags                    = {
    Managed_by = "Packer"
    Built_by   = "Packer"
  }
} 

build {
  sources = ["source.baiducloud-bcc.example-1"]
  
  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = [
      "Sleep 30",
      "yum install redis.x86_64 -y",
    ]
  }
}
```

</Tab>

If you have set `BAIDUCLOUD_ACCESS_KEY` and `BAIDUCLOUD_SECRET_KEY` environment variables,
You can also not set `access_key` and `secret_key` fields, 
because the plug-in can automatically read environment variables.

The example is blow.

<Tab heading="HCL2">

```hcl
source "baiducloud-bcc" "example-1" {
  region          = "fwh"
  zone            = "cn-fwh-a"
  source_image_id = "m-sDghxZu1"
  instance_spec   = "bcc.ic4.c2m2"
  image_name      = "packer-test"
  associate_public_ip_address = true 
  use_default_network         = true 
  ssh_username                = "root"
  run_tags                    = {
    Managed_by = "Packer"
    Built_by   = "Packer"
  }
} 

build {
  sources = ["source.baiducloud-bcc.example-1"]
  
  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = [
      "Sleep 30",
      "yum install redis.x86_64 -y",
    ]
  }
}
```

</Tab>

You can also use the JSON format configuration file, although it is being deprecated.

Here is a basic example for Baiducloud using JSON format.

<Tab heading="JSON">

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "access_key": "{{env `BAIDUCLOUD_ACCESS_KEY`}}",
    "secret_key": "{{env `BAIDUCLOUD_SECRET_KEY`}}"
  },
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "baiducloud-bcc",
      "access_key": "{{user `access_key`}}",
      "secret_key": "{{user `secret_key`}}",
      "region": "fwh",
      "zone": "cn-fwh-a",
      "source_image_id": "m-sDghxZu1",
      "instance_spec": "bcc.ic4.c2m2",
      "image_name": "packer-test",
      "associate_public_ip_address": true,
      "use_default_network": true,
      "ssh_username": "root",
      "run_tags": {
        "Managed_by": "Packer",
        "Built_by": "Packer"
      }
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "inline": ["sleep 30", "yum install redis.x86_64 -y"]
    }
  ]
}
```
